```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. confidence intervals

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38, 41, 50, 27, 32, 41, 48, 60, 43)

t.test(otter_length)
```

### 95 of 100 samples will have population mean
#### mean length is 42.222, 95% confidence {34.69302 to 49.75142}
##### t test is going against null that length = 0; hence small p-value

## T-test (1-sample t-test)
see claim: mean otter length is 50 inches

```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x=otter_length, mu = 50)
otter_test
```

if pop is 50in, then 4.4% chance to get randam sample as diff from 50 as our sample is

## two sample t-test

```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32, 44, 18, 26, 50, 33, 42, 20)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28, 31, 40, 42, 26, 29, 31)

t.test(x = desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns)
```
